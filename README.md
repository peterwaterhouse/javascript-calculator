# javascript-calculator

This is an old-fashioned style calculator coded in Javascript without using the eval() method. It was completed as a programming exercise to apply and practice skills in JS, CSS and HTML. More specifically, things like events, listeners, functions, and flexbox.

TODO/Improvements that could be made: 
- Disallow the user from overflowing the screen with digits.
- Lots of refactoring - I should add a 'for' loop for assigning listeners/events rather than the repeat lines over and over early on in the script
- Add hover/click css pseudoclasses for better UI responsivenesss
